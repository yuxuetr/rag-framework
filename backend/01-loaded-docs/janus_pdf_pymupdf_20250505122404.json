Specif-\nically, Janus-Pro incorporates (1) an optimized training strategy, (2) expanded training data,\nand (3) scaling to larger model size. With these improvements, Janus-Pro achieves significant\nadvancements in both multimodal understanding and text-to-image instruction-following capa-\nbilities, while also enhancing the stability of text-to-image generation. We hope this work will\ninspire further exploration in the field. Code and models are publicly available.\n1.

Janus-Pro delivers more stable outputs for short prompts, with improved visual quality,\nricher details, and the ability to generate simple text. The image resolution is 384 × 384. Best\nviewed on screen.\nRecent advancements in unified multimodal understanding and generation models have\ndemonstrated significant progress [30, 40, 45, 46, 48, 50, 54, 55]. These approaches have been\nproven to enhance the instruction-following capabilities in visual generation tasks while re-\nducing model redundancy. Most of these methods utilize the same visual encoder to process\ninputs for both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Since the representations\nrequired for these two tasks differ, this often results in suboptimal performance in multimodal\nunderstanding. To address this issue, Janus [46] proposes decoupling visual encoding, which\nalleviates the conflict between multimodal understanding and generation tasks, achieving\nexcellent performance in both tasks.\nAs a pioneering model, Janus is validated at the 1B parameter scale. However, due to the\nlimited amount of training data and the relatively small model capacity, it exhibites certain\nshortcomings, such as suboptimal performance on short prompts image generation and unstable\ntext-to-image generation quality. In this paper, we introduce Janus-Pro, an enhanced version of\nJanus that incorporates improvements across three dimensions: training strategies, data, and\nmodel size. The Janus-Pro series includes two model sizes: 1B and 7B, demonstrating scalability\nof the visual encoding decoding method.\nWe evaluate Janus-Pro on multiple benchmarks, and the results reveal its superior multi-\nmodal understanding capabilities and significantly improved text-to-image instruction-following\nperformance. Specifically, Janus-Pro-7B achieved a score of 79.2 on the multimodal understand-\ning benchmark MMBench [29], surpassing state-of-the-art unified multimodal models such as\nJanus [46] (69.4), TokenFlow [34] (68.9) and MetaMorph [42] (75.2). Additionally, in the text-to-\nimage instruction-following leaderboard GenEval [14], Janus-Pro-7B scores 0.80, outperforming\nJanus [46] (0.61), DALL-E 3 (0.67), and Stable Diffusion 3 Medium [11] (0.74).\n2",

We decouple visual encoding for multimodal under-\nstanding and visual generation. “Und. Encoder” and “Gen. Encoder” are abbreviations for\n“Understanding Encoder” and “Generation Encoder”, respectively. Best viewed on screen.\n2. Method\n2.1. Architecture\nThe architecture of Janus-Pro is shown in Figure 3, which is the same as Janus [46]. The core\ndesign principle of the overall architecture is to decouple visual encoding for multimodal\nunderstanding and generation. We apply independent encoding methods to convert the raw\ninputs into features, which are then processed by an unified autoregressive transformer. For\nmultimodal understanding, we use the SigLIP [53] encoder to extract high-dimensional semantic\nfeatures from images. These features are flattened from a 2-D grid into a 1-D sequence, and an\nunderstanding adaptor is used to map these image features into the input space of the LLM. For\nvisual generation tasks, we use the VQ tokenizer from [38] to convert images into discrete IDs.\nAfter the ID sequence is flattened into 1-D, we use a generation adaptor to map the codebook\nembeddings corresponding to each ID into the input space of the LLM. We then concatenate\nthese feature sequences to form a multimodal feature sequence, which is subsequently fed into\nthe LLM for processing. Apart from the built-in prediction head in the LLM, we also utilize a\nrandomly initialized prediction head for image predictions in the visual generation task. The\nentire model adheres to an autoregressive framework.\n2.2. Optimized Training Strategy\nThe previous version of Janus employs a three-stage training process. Stage I focuses on\ntraining the adaptors and the image head. Stage II handles unified pretraining, during which all\ncomponents except the understanding encoder and the generation encoder has their parameters\nupdated. Stage III is supervised fine-tuning, building upon Stage II by further unlocking the\nparameters of the understanding encoder during training. This training strategy has certain\nissues. In Stage II, Janus divides the training for text-to-image capabilities into two parts\nfollowing PixArt [4]. The first part trains on ImageNet [9] data, using image category names\nas prompts for text-to-image generation, with the goal of modeling pixel dependence. The\nsecond part trains on normal text-to-image data. During implementation, 66.67% of the text-\nto-image training steps in Stage II are allocated to the first part. However, through further\n3",

      "content": "experimentation, we find that this strategy is suboptimal and lead to significant computational\ninefficiency.\nTo address this issue, we make two modifications.\n• Longer Training in Stage I: We increase the training steps in Stage I, allowing sufficient\ntraining on the ImageNet dataset. Our findings reveals that even with the LLM parameters\nfixed, the model could effectively model pixel dependence and generate reasonable images\nbased on category names.\n• Focused Training in Stage II: In Stage II, we drop ImageNet data and directly utilize nor-\nmal text-to-image data to train the model to generate images based on dense descriptions.\nThis redesigned approach enables Stage II to utilize the text-to-image data more efficiently,\nresulting in improved training efficiency and overall performance.\nWe also adjust the data ratio in Stage III supervised fine-tuning process across different types\nof datasets, changing the proportion of multimodal data, pure text data, and text-to-image data\nfrom 7:3:10 to 5:1:4. By slightly reducing the proportion of text-to-image data, we observe that\nthis adjustment allows us to maintain strong visual generation capabilities while achieving\nimproved multimodal understanding performance.\n2.3. Data Scaling\nWe scale up the training data used for Janus in both multimodal understanding and visual\ngeneration aspects.\n• Multimodal Understanding. For the Stage II pretraining data, we refer to DeepSeek-\nVL2 [49] and add approximately 90 million samples. These include image caption datasets\n(e.g., YFCC [31]), as well as data for table, chart, and document understanding (e.g., Doc-\nmatix [20]). For the Stage III supervised fine-tuning data, we also incorporate additional\ndatasets from DeepSeek-VL2, such as MEME understanding, Chinese conversational data,\nand datasets aimed at enhancing dialogue experiences. These additions significantly\nexpanded the model’s capabilities, enriching its ability to handle diverse tasks while\nimproving the overall conversational experience.\n• Visual Generation. We observe that the real-world data used in the previous version of\nJanus lacks quality and contains significant noise, which often leads to instability in text-\nto-image generation, resulting in aesthetically poor outputs. In Janus-Pro, we incorporate\napproximately 72 million samples of synthetic aesthetic data, bringing the ratio of real to\nsynthetic data to 1:1 during the unified pretraining stage. The prompts for these synthetic\ndata samples are publicly available, such as those in [43]. Experiments demonstrat that the\nmodel converges faster when trained on synthetic data, and the resulting text-to-image\noutputs are not only more stable but also exhibit significantly improved aesthetic quality.\n2.4. Model Scaling\nThe previous version of Janus validates the effectiveness of visual encoding decoupling using\na 1.5B LLM. In Janus-Pro, we scaled the model up to 7B, with the hyperparameters of both\nthe 1.5B and 7B LLMs detailed in Table 1. We observe that when utilizing a larger-scale LLM,\nthe convergence speed of losses for both multimodal understanding and visual generation\nimproved significantly compared to the smaller model. This finding further validates the strong\nscalability of this approach.\n4",

Experiments\n3.1. Implementation Details\nIn our experiments, we utilize DeepSeek-LLM (1.5B and 7B) [3] with a maximum supported\nsequence length of 4096 as the base language model. For the vision encoder used in understand-\ning tasks, we select SigLIP-Large-Patch16-384 [53]. The generation encoder has a codebook of\nsize 16, 384 and downsamples images by a factor of 16. Both the understanding adaptor and\nthe generation adaptor are two-layer MLPs. The detailed hyperparameters for each stage are\nprovided in Table 2. Please note that for Stage II, we employ an early stopping strategy, halting\nat 270K steps. All images are resized to 384 × 384 pixels. For multimodal understanding data,\nwe resize the long side of the image and pad the short side with the background color (RGB: 127,\n127, 127) to reach 384. For visual generation data, the short side is resized to 384, and the long\nside is cropped to 384. We use sequence packing during training to improve training efficiency.\nWe mix all data types according to the specified ratios in a single training step. Our Janus-Pro\nis trained and evaluated using HAI-LLM [15], which is a lightweight and efficient distributed\ntraining framework built on top of PyTorch. The whole training process took about 9/14 days\non a cluster of 16/32 nodes for 1.5B/7B model, each equipped with 8 Nvidia A100 (40GB) GPUs.\n3.2. Evaluation Setup\nMultimodal Understanding.

When compared\nto models with significantly larger sizes, Janus-Pro remains highly competitive. For instance,\nJanus-Pro-7B outperforms TokenFlow-XL (13B) on all benchmarks except GQA.\n6",

Janus-Pro exhibits impressive\ncomprehension abilities when handling inputs from various contexts, showcasing its powerful\ncapabilities. We also present some text-to-image generation results in the lower part of Figure 4.\nThe images generated by Janus-Pro-7B are highly realistic, and despite having a resolution of\nonly 384 × 384, they still contain a lot of details. For imaginative and creative scenes, Janus-Pro-\n7B accurately captures the semantic information from the prompts, producing well-reasoned\nand coherent images.\n7",

      "content": "4. Conclusion\nThis paper introduces improvements to Janus from three aspects: training strategy, data, and\nmodel size. These enhancements have led to significant advancements in both multimodal\nunderstanding and text-to-image instruction-following capabilities. However, Janus-Pro still\nhas certain limitations. In terms of multimodal understanding, the input resolution is limited\nto 384 × 384, which affects its performance in fine-grained tasks such as OCR. For text-to-\nimage generation, the low resolution, combined with reconstruction losses introduced by the\nvision tokenizer, results in images that, while rich in semantic content, still lack fine details.\nFor example, small facial regions occupying limited image space may appear under-detailed.\nIncreasing the image resolution could mitigate these issues.\nReferences\n[1] J.
